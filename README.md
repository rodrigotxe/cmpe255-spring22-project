Objective: Train a model to generate images of hybrid flower species based on user input.
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/l3llff/flowers

Week 1:
- Develop a classifier for the flowers dataset

Week 2:
- Develop a basic GAN and train it on the flowers dataset
- Develop the web app UI in Flask to allow users to define custom flower hybrids

Week 3:
- Combine the basic GAN with the classifier to make a cycleGAN so that the generator can learn to associate the user input with the expected output
- Integrate the final trained GAN with the Flask app
